### Project Overview
Title: Hospital Management System

This project aims to create a comprehensive Hospital Management System using Python, with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The system will facilitate the management of patient prescriptions and related data, ensuring efficient operations within a hospital environment.

Components of the Project
GUI Layout:

The interface is divided into multiple frames for better organization and usability.
a. Left Frame:
Input Fields: This frame includes text fields for users to input patient data, prescription details, and other relevant information.
Patient Name: Text input for entering the patientâ€™s name.
Patient ID: Numeric input for a unique patient identifier.
Medicine Name: Text input for specifying the medication prescribed.
Dosage: Text input for indicating the dosage (e.g., "500mg").
Duration: Input for the duration of the prescription (e.g., "5 days").
b. Right Frame:
Prescription Data Display: This section shows the details of prescriptions entered, allowing users to review and verify the data.
Labels or Text Areas: Use labels or text areas to display the entered prescription details in a clear format.
Button Functionality:

Below the input fields, there are several buttons that perform specific actions:
Prescription: This button processes the input data and generates a prescription.
Prescription Data: Displays or retrieves previously entered prescriptions from the database.
Delete: Allows users to remove specific entries from the database.
Update: Facilitates updating existing prescription details based on user input.
Clear: Resets all input fields and the displayed data to their initial states.
Exit: Closes the application.
Data Representation:

Tabular Representation: Below the button section, a table (using ttk.Treeview from Tkinter) displays all entered prescription data. This provides an overview of all records and enhances user interaction.
Database Connectivity:

MySQL Database: The application connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve patient and prescription data.
Database Operations:
Insert: Adding new prescriptions into the database.
Select: Fetching existing prescriptions for display.
Update: Modifying existing records based on user inputs.
Delete: Removing records from the database.
Libraries and Modules Used
Tkinter: The primary library for creating the GUI. It provides tools to create windows, frames, buttons, labels, and more.

tkcalendar: This module can be used if you want to incorporate a calendar for selecting dates, such as prescription duration or appointment dates.

MySQL Connector: A library that allows Python to connect to a MySQL database, enabling the execution of SQL queries for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
